When we talk about improving our ranking through SEO, we’re generally referring to Google’s ranking factors as opposed to Bing, Yahoo, or other alternative search engines. That’s why it’s so important to learn how to help your content appear at the top of Google’s search engine results pages (SERPs) when your target audience searches for keywords relating to your products or services.

However, some ranking factors are more important than others.
